# Tic-Tac-Toe-IMPOSSIBLE 🎮
This is an unbeatable **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where no matter what, you can never win! 😎🎉

Created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the game utilizes the powerful [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to ensure that the computer player always plays optimally. Whether you play against the computer or try to outsmart it, victory is nearly impossible as the algorithm evaluates every possible move to block your wins and make perfect decisions. 🤖

## How It Works: 🧠
The game uses the **Minimax Algorithm**, which is a decision-making algorithm used for two-player games. It looks ahead at all possible moves and evaluates which one will lead to the most optimal outcome. The computer simulates every possible move for both players, choosing the one that minimizes your chances of winning, while maximizing its own chances. 🔮
